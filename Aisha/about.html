    <!-- Candidate Story inside the black quote section -->
    <p>
      Aisha Jumwa Karisa Katana, born on 28 March 1975 in the historic village of Takaungu, Kilifi County, is a bold and resilient leader whose political journey reflects determination, courage, and unwavering commitment to public service. Rising from humble beginnings, she has carved out a remarkable path in Kenya’s political landscape, becoming one of the most influential voices from the Coast region.
    </p>

    <p>
      She most recently served as the Cabinet Secretary for Gender, a role she held until 11 July 2024, when she was relieved of her duties by President William Ruto. Prior to this, Aisha Jumwa represented Malindi Constituency as a Member of Parliament from 2017 to 2022 and served concurrently as a Commissioner of the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC). Her leadership journey began much earlier, first as the Woman Representative for Kilifi County from 2013 to 2017, and even before that as a Councillor for Takaungu Ward between 1997 and 2007 — a testament to her deep-rooted connection with grassroots leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her early life was marked by significant challenges, but these only strengthened her resolve. With perseverance and self-belief, she pursued education later in life, completing her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education in 2011. She went on to earn a Bachelor’s Degree in Leadership and Management from the International Leadership University (ILU) in 2020, alongside an Executive Diploma in Governance from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology — academic milestones that mirror her lifelong commitment to growth and service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Politically, Aisha Jumwa has been a trailblazer. She made history as the first Woman Representative for Kilifi County in 2013 and later secured victory as the Member of Parliament for Malindi Constituency in 2017. Throughout her career, she has been a fierce advocate for the marginalized, championing the rights and empowerment of women, youth, and persons with disabilities, while remaining a formidable force in coastal politics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following her entry into the United Democratic Alliance (UDA), Jumwa boldly declared her intention to vie for the governorship of Kilifi County. Her vision is anchored in inclusive development, accountability, and transformative leadership. Even beyond elected office, she continues to serve her community with passion, standing as a symbol of resilience, ambition, and unwavering dedication to the people she represents.
